# Audio DSP Resources
My curated list of audio digital signal processing resources. New resources may be added in the future. Feel free to open a PR if you wish!

## Free Online Textbooks
- [`The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing`] by Steven W. Smith, Ph.D.
  - A common recommendation from many folks.
  - Focuses on DSP in general, not just audio DSP.

- [`Julius Orion Smith III Collection`]
  - A collection of books and resources by Julius Orion Smith III.
  - Relatively heavy on mathematics.

- [`The Theory and Technique of Electronic Music`] by Miller Puckette
  - Focuses more on musical DSP.
  - Also relatively heavy on mathematics.

## Paid Textbooks
- [`Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++`] and [`Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++`] by Will Pirkle
  - One of the most highly recommended resources for entering the world of audio DSP.
  - Great beginner resource that teaches fundamental DSP concepts with examples.
  - The synthesizer one is better than the effect one imo, so go for that if you plan on only buying one.
  - Focuses on teaching concepts, not on writing performant code. His coding sytle is quite ineffecient.
  - There will also be [`newer edition`] in 2021 as well.

- [`A Digital Signal Processing Primer`] by Kenneth Steiglitz
  - Great introduction to the mathematics of DSP.
  - Focuses more and mathematics and does not have many example effects.

- [`DAFX: Digital Audio Effects`] by Udo ZÃ¶lzer (Editor)
  - Explores good modern advanced effects. It's made by the [`DAFx`] annual scientific research conference.
  - MATLAB is used for its code examples, so stomach that if you can.

## Mathematics
- [`3Blue1Brown`] - An excellent YouTube channel on complex algebra, linear algebra, calculus, and differential equations.
  - His videos on [`Euler's Formula`] and the [`Fourier Transform`] are particularly excellent.
- This video on the [`Laplace Transform`] by Zach Star.

## Algorithms & Technical Reading
- [`Musicdsp.org`] - A collection of open source DSP algorithms by the community.
- [`Cytomic Technical Papers`] - Excellent real-world useable filters and explanations by Cytomic.
- [`deip.pdf`] - High quality resampling and oversampling.
- [`Freeverb`] - An open-source reverb algorithm.
- [`DAFx`] - An archive of scientific papers and presentations given during an annual DSP research conference.

## Open Source Plugins & Software
Reading the source code of real-world projects can give valueable insight into different techniques and solutions people have come up with over the years.
### Synths
- [`Helm`] - High-quality modern synthesizer with a flexible modulation system. The oscillators and not stereo though.
- [`Surge`] - Feature-rich hybrid synthesizer that was once sold as a commercial product.
- [`Dexed`] - Synthesizer closely modelled after the Yamaha DX7.

- [`Dragonfly Reverb`] - Algorithmic reverb based on [`Freeverb`].
- [`CloudReverb`] - Beautiful shimmering reverb based on the `CloudSeed` plugin by Valdemar Erlingsson. I choose this over the original as that uses a Windows-only C# platform for its GUI.
- [`EQ10Q`] - A suite of plugins containing a 10-band parametric equalizer, gate, compressor, bass enhancer, and mid-side encoders.
- [`Luftikus`] - Good quality analogue modeled equalizer.

- [`NDC Plugs`] - Three simple effects including a distortion pedal effect.
- [`Fogpad`] - Reverb plugin where reflections can be frozen, filtered, pitch-shifted, and mangled.
- [`Stone Phaser`] - Classic analogue-modeled phaser effect.
- [`YK Chorus`] - Classic analogue-modeled chorus effect.

- [`DISTRHO Plugin Framework`] - More example plugins can be found listed here.
### MIDI FX
- [`QMidiArp`] - Advanced arpeggiator, sequencer, and MIDI LFO.
### Meters & Visualizers
- [`Spectacle`] - Modern real-time spectrum analyzer plugin.
- [`Wolf Spectrum`] - Real-time heat-map spectrum analyzer plugin.
- [`EasySSP`] - Real-time spectrum analyzer and stereo analyzer plugin.
- [`LUFS Meter`] - Real-time loudness meter with support for several international loudness standards.
### DAWs & Hosts
- [`Ardour`] - Feature-rich DAW. Focuses more on recorded music production over electronic music production.
- [`LMMS`] - Feature-rich DAW focused on electronic music production. Contains many built-in synths and effects.
- [`Audacity`] - Popular multi-track audio editor.
- [`Carla`] - Cross platform plugin host with support for many plugin formats.

## Sound Design & Mixing
While this is not *strictly* development related, knowing how plugins are actually used can give valuable insight.
- [`SeamlessR`] - This guy is a great teacher and really knows his stuff.
- [`Au5`] - A beast legend. Need I say more?

## Software Optimization
- [`Intel Intrinsics Guide`] - x86 processor instrinsics
- Follow these rules:

- [`pluginval`] - Cross-platform open-source plugin validation tool made by the company Tracktion.

## Plugin Development Frameworks
- Rust Community Framework
  - Full-stack modular framework in Rust (currently a WIP and not production ready yet). I'm personally biased towards this as one of the main contributors.
  - [`baseplug`] - Provides an abstraction-layer over the different plugin formats, and simplifies parameter management.
    - Does not contain a GUI framework, but other frameworks can be attached to provide the GUI.
    - Currently only targets the VST2 plugin format. VST3, AU, LV2, and JACK targets are currently planned.
    - Targets Mac, Windows, and Linux platforms.
  - [`baseview`] - Provides windowing and input events for plugins / standalone applications.
    - Targets Mac, Windows, and Linux.

    - Targets Mac, Windows, and Linux.
  - [`iced_audio`] - An extension to the [`iced`] GUI framework that provides audio-specific widgets like knobs and sliders.
  - [`iced-baseplug-examples`] - Example plugins built using the [`baseplug`], [`iced_baseview`], and [`iced_audio`] modules.
  - [`goldenrod`] - A personal raster-based GUI framework built on top of [`baseview`]. Currently very WIP and experimental.
    - Targets Mac, Windows, and Linux.

  - Full-stack framework with GUI in te D programming language (if you're into that sort-of thing).
  - The GUI framework has fancy physically-modeled rendering inspired by game engines.
  - Targets VST2, VST3, AUv2, AAX, and LV2 plugin formats.
  - Targets Mac, Windows, Linux, and Raspberry Pi platforms.
  - Used by several commercial plugins.
- [`JUCE`]
  - Full-stack framework with GUI in C++. Open source, but some of its modules require a hefty commercial license to use.
  - Targets VST2, VST3, AUv2, AUv3, RTAS, and AAX plugin formats.
  - Targets Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and Raspberry Pi platforms.
  - Well known, and many commercial plugins are built with it.
- [`Tracktion Engine`]
  - Full-stack framework in C++ with GUI. It built on top of on [`JUCE`].
  - Targeted formats and platforms are the same as [`JUCE`].
  - Made and used by the commercial company Tracktion.
- [`iPlug2`]
  - Full-stack framework in C++ with GUI. Fully open-source.
  - Targets VST2, VST3, AUv2, AUv3, AAX and the Web Audio Module (WAM) plugin formats.
  - Targets Mac, Windows, iOS, and Web. It does not target Linux, so I'm personally not a fan of this one.
