# Audio DSP Resources
My curated list of audio Digital Signal Processing resources. New resources may be added in the future. Feel free to create a PR if you wish!

## DSP textbooks

- [`Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++`] and [`Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++`] by Will Pirkle
  - Great beginner resource that teaches fundamental DSP concepts with examples.
  - Focuses on teaching concepts, not on writing performant code. His coding sytle is quite ineffecient.

- [`The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing`] by Steven W. Smith, Ph.D.
  - Free online book on DSP in general.

## Mathematics

- [`3Blue1Brown`] - An excellent YouTube channel on complex algebra, linear algebra, calculus, and differential equations.
  - His video on the [`Fourier Transform`] is particularly excellent.
- This video on the [`Laplace Transform`].

## Algorithms

- [`Musicdsp.org`] - A collection of open source DSP algorithms by the community.
- [`Cytomic Technical Papers`] - Excellent real-world useable filters and explanations by Cytomic.
- [`Freeverb`]: An open-source reverb algorithm.

## Software Optimization

- [`Intel Intrinsics Guide`] - x86 processor instrinsics
- Follow these rules:

## Math Tools
- [`Desmos`] - Free online graphing calculator.
- [`Wolfram Alpha`] - A helpful math partner.
- [`Curcuit JS`] - A cool little circuit simulation tool.

## Rust Resources
- [`simdeez`] - Write generic SIMD code across an array of architectures.
- [`FunDSP`] - An audio DSP library with a custom clean syntax.
- [`Learn Rust the Dangerous Way`]: Tips on writing low-level Rust code from a C background.
- [`How-to Optimize Rust Programs on Linux`]: How-to guide on profiling Rust code on Linux.

## Forums
- [`Rust Audio Discord Server`] - A community of passionate Rust audio programmers.
